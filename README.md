# Prediction-of-wine-type
The "Prediction of Wine Type using Sequential Networks" project focuses on utilizing Sequential neural networks to predict the type of wine based on various features and attributes. By training the model on a dataset containing information about different wine characteristics, such as acidity, alcohol content, and color intensity, the project aims to create an accurate classification system. Sequential networks are particularly well-suited for this task as they can capture temporal patterns and dependencies within the data. The project's goal is to provide wineries and enthusiasts with a reliable tool for classifying wines and enhancing the understanding of the factors that contribute to each wine type.
